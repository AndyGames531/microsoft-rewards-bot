# microsoft-rewards-bot

Go see wiki for the downloads 

I try my best to make some money, it is open source so I wont charge anything but please consider donating(see bottom of the README.md). And i will leave download links to linkvertise(a way to monetize my downloads) if unfamiliar with linkvertise, dont use it but i will have documented tutorials and video tutorials showing how to download and setup, i want to make tutorials for the linkvertise because it is possible that it contains missleading ads)

This is a microsoft rewards bot. Ive seen alot of projects regarding this but i havnt been able to find any that work(i couldve installed it incorrectly)
I decided ill make it myself using python simply because python is a powerfull scripting language basically built for this task.
I probably wont be working on this too often because i have to learn python first :)
if you want to contribute, submit a pull request (unless theres like thousands of them. at that point ill change the system)
im gonna focus this for windows and it will utilize microsoft edge(other operating systems will come)
and to get the mobile search points i will utilize an android emulator that you will have to install on your system(it will be part of the prerequisites, unless you're on a linux distribution because linux doesnt currently have a supported android emulator)

I will leave my social medias on the wiki, in my github profile and on my website(andygames.ca)
